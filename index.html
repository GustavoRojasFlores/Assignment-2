    <h2>What did Ada Lovelace do?</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace made an extremely significant contribution to the world of computing and technology. She was deemed the first computer programmer in the world after she wrote the very first algorithm for the Analytical Engine designed by Charles Babbage, even though the machine was never built at the time.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born on December 10th of 1815 in London, and died in 1852. During her childhood, her father left her mother when Ada was five weeks old, and died when Ada was eight years of age. Growing up, she started learning mathematics and science at age seventeen, privately taught by her tutor Mary Somerville, who was her good friend at the time. After her education, her friend Mary introduced her to Charles Babbage, the designer and inventor of the Analytical Engine. Babbage was impressed with her scientific and mathenatic intellect, and he invited to show her his machine design. When she took at look at it, she was fascinated and began writing the very first algorithm for a computer.</p>
